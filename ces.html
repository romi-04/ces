    <h1>Welcome to CES!</h1>

    <p><h2>Gyrating about the branch, CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY was established in 2008
         by the students of NIT Jamshedpur. This was the result of fervent demeanor of
          several civil engineers who were looking for a common platform for the civil
           engineers all round the country, to share their views and ideas. 
           The Civil Engineering Society (CES), an NIT Jamshedpur initiative is 
           intensifying day by day since the day of its opening. This tree with its root in NIT JSR,
            is growing its branches all round the country. At present the society has its 
            member working in reputed firms, students of different colleges etc. Due to lots 
            of prolific activities conducted by society such as Guest Lectures, it has developed 
            links with officials and renowned personalities too. The working approach of CES is very lucid.
             It basically regroups the persons, with different ideologies, who have travelled a common 
             path of civil engineering. We have first year as well as alumni of 90s batch in our member
              list thereby creating a common stage for younkers and Big Daddy of this field. </h2></p>
